All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

Welcome to the room of people who have rooms of people
That they loved one day docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
